# DensityLaughlin
This fortran code computes the density of particles in fractional quantum hall state over a circular system, defined by Laughlin state of given filling factor. Filling factor 1 gives us integer qH (quantum Hall) state and its density, where as filling factor 1/3 gives us the density of fqH state. 
It generates a matrix where row and column have radial and angular profile of density respectively.
A python code is attached to read the file and generate a 2D heat plot.
